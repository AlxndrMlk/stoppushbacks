    Migrants on Belarusian-Polish border including children, elderly and women are pushed back and forth between the two countries.
    They are trapped in the forest. They lack food, water and are deprived of any - even most basic shelter.
    No NGOs nor medical assistance is allowed to help them because of the state of emergency declared by Poland.

<p>We <strong>disagree</strong> to the practice of <strong>push-backs</strong> for <strong>children</strong> and their <strong>families!</strong></p>
